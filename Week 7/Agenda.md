# Week 7 - 

## Code Review - Chessboard - who knows!!!
---

i MAY have forgotton to assign this to someone.

## Check up
---

Questions on last weeks stuff, arrays, memory, BMP, server etc. 

For people who have the practice exam coming up now is the time to maybe go through a question together. 

## Assignment 0 Debrif

If you could go back in time and do the assignment again, what would you do differently?

## Abstraction

discussion time: What do you think it is

> One of the most important rules from the course style guide is that every function should have one specific purpose. You should be able to describe what a function does with one simple statement.

1. Discuss with your class some strategies you can use to keep your code from becoming complex

2. strategies for making sure that your code is easy to understand.

3. Discuss how you might be able to tell if your code is becoming too complex or hard to understand.

4. How could you improve your assignment code using the strategies you discussed?


## Australia’s Funniest Home Flow Control Fragments
---

In pairs write some code fragments using the control flow blocks you have learnt so far: including functions, if/else blocks, and while loops.

Include an equal mix of logic, style, and syntax errors, and correct fragments.

(It’s better to write a lot of small code fragments with one or two errors each rather than one or two code fragments with a lot of errors each.)

Swap your fragments with another group and see which errors you can spot. Discuss together in your combined group of four and then pick the best ones to test the whole tutorial class. Prizes, fame, glory.

## Assignment 1 - Mandelbrot

## What is the mandlebrot set?


## Example

`int escapeSteps(double x, double y);`

What should the output be for the following x,y inputs (assuming MAX_ITERATIONS is 256).

0, 0

-2, -2

-1 1

Why is this function useful?
